# Operational Plan – El Tor Integrated Project (Start January 2026)

> **Legend**\
> **MSB = Moringa Seed‑Tree Block** (3 × 5 m spacing, light leaf pruning, main seed source)\
> **MLB = Moringa Leaf‑Intensive Block** (30 cm rows, high‑frequency leaf harvest)\
> **CFB = Cactus Fig Block**\
> **SAB = Sidr-Acacia Belt** (6 × 6 m grid, 2:1 Sidr:Acacia ratio)

## Project Scope — "El Tor Integrated Desert Farm"

| Item | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Purpose** | Build a closed‑loop, 240‑feddan (≈ 1 km²) regenerative farm in El Tor, South Sinai that (1) feeds ≈ 100 beef cattle year‑round, (2) produces its own biodiesel & ethanol, and (3) generates three cash streams — cactus fruit, moringa oil + press‑cake, and monofloral honey (cactus, moringa, premium Sidr). |
| **Land‑use architecture** | A – Wind‑break ring: 4 × 4 m moringa seed trees, ≈ 25 feddans (continuous 30 m band).<br>B – Sidr + Acacia belts: two rings totalling 40–55 feddans; tree grid 6 × 6 m, pattern 1 Acacia : 2 Sidr.<br>  • Leaf‑moringa intercrops: 4 rows × 30 cm (1.2 m) + 1.5 m lanes between every tree row.<br>C – Cactus‑fig core: ≈ 150 feddans; rows N‑S, 2.5 m × 1.5 m.<br>D – Service / residential hub: ≈ 10 feddans centre‑east (roads, compost yard, workshop, housing).<br>(Option) Dedicated 10–15 feddan high‑density leaf‑moringa block if extra feed security desired. |
| **Target outputs** (steady‑state, Year 5) | • Feed: ≈ 535 t DM yr‑¹ (cactus pads ½ + leaf‑moringa) → 100 cattle.<br>• Oil: ≈ 8 000 L moringa oil yr‑¹ + 5 t press‑cake.<br>• Ethanol: 1 500–3 000 L yr‑¹ from ≤ 2 % cactus pads (enough for trans‑esterification).<br>• Honey: cactus (spring), moringa (summer) & 400–600 kg "3assal Sidr" (autumn).<br>• Fruit: 6–8 t feddan‑¹ × 150 f → 900–1 200 t fresh pads + 900 t fruit → farm‑gate revenue ≈ EGP 4.5–9 M yr‑¹. |
| **Water plan** | Total demand ≈ 0.8 Mm³ yr‑¹.<br>– Cactus drip: 400–600 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹ (deep pulse, 12‑day).<br>– Leaf‑moringa porous pipe: 2 300 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹.<br>– Sidr basins & Acacia: ≈ 250 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹ (establishment only). |

## Key Plant Species & Their Roles

### Moringa (Moringa oleifera)
**System importance:** Primary multi-function species providing feed, oil, and nectar.
- **Revenue streams:** High-value oil (≈8,000 L/yr), protein-rich press-cake (5 t/yr), summer honey.
- **Feed value:** 25-30% protein DM, excellent amino acid profile, high vitamin content.
- **Risks:** Frost sensitive; requires irrigation management; susceptible to aphids during stress periods.
- **Management strategy:** Dual cultivation approach (MSB for seeds, MLB for leaf production) maximizes utility while providing system redundancy.

### Cactus Fig (Opuntia ficus-indica)
**System importance:** Core production species providing fruit, fodder, and water storage.
- **Revenue streams:** Primary cash crop (900-1,200 t fruit/yr), spring honey.
- **Feed value:** Low protein (4-6%) but high energy and water content; excellent drought buffer.
- **Risks:** Susceptible to cochineal insects; fruit quality affected by humidity at ripening.
- **Management strategy:** North-south row orientation maximizes light interception; scheduled pad harvesting maintains plant vigor and feed quality.

### Sidr (Ziziphus spina-christi)
**System importance:** Deep-rooted native tree providing premium honey, shade, and soil improvement.
- **Revenue streams:** Premium "3assal Sidr" honey (400-600 kg/yr), highest value product per unit.
- **Ecological value:** Drought-resistant native species; supports beneficial insects; deep root system accesses subsurface moisture.
- **Risks:** Slow establishment; requires protection during early growth.
- **Management strategy:** Strategic placement in belts; 2:1 ratio with Acacia for nitrogen balance.

### Acacia (Acacia nilotica/tortilis)
**System importance:** Nitrogen-fixing support species enhancing soil fertility.
- **Revenue streams:** Indirect through soil improvement and system resilience.
- **Ecological value:** Fixes 40-80 kg N/ha/yr; provides shade; contributes to windbreak function.
- **Risks:** Potential for excessive spread if not managed; thorns require careful handling.
- **Management strategy:** Intercropped with Sidr at 1:2 ratio; periodic pruning provides biochar feedstock.

### System Integration Benefits
The plant selection creates complementary seasonal production cycles, diversified revenue streams, and ecological resilience through functional diversity. The spatial arrangement optimizes water use efficiency while the multi-story design maximizes photosynthetic capture per unit area.


## Biochar Production & Land‑Expansion Loop

**Purpose.** Supply 20–25 t biochar yr⁻¹ from on‑site residues to rehabilitate 4–8 feddans of new beds or tree lines each season.

| Feedstock (dry) | Annual qty | Pyrolysis note | Biochar yield |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Cactus pad trimmings (old pads + ethanol pulp) | 40 t | Rotary drum, 400 °C | ~10 t |
| Acacia & Sidr prunings | 20 t | Batch retort, 450 °C | ~5 t |
| Spoiled moringa press‑cake + leaf litter | 15 t | Mixed with woody feedstock | ~4 t |
| **Total** | **75 t** |  | **≈ 19 t biochar yr⁻¹** |

**Application.** Incorporate 3 t feddan‑¹ with compost into new cactus or tree expansion plots; priority = marginal corners and newly ripped beds.

**Reactor set‑up (2026 Q4).** One 2 m³ top‑lift retort (charcoal style) + small 500 kg h⁻¹ rotary kiln for continuous pad flow. Syngas routed to water pre‑heater.

## Mechanical Harvest Module (MLB)

*Goes live once leaf‑moringa beds >15 feddans (target 2028).*

* **Lane geometry:** 1.5 m left + 1.2 m cutting strip + 1.5 m right lane.
* **Hardware:** Two electric flat‑deck carts (<1.2 m wide) with shared 1.2 m sickle‑bar suspended on telescopic arms.
* **Catcher:** Raised nylon “hammock” net 25 cm above soil – clears 15 cm stumps.
* **Through‑put:** 5 feddans day⁻¹ per two‑person crew (8 h).

---

## Nutrient Cycling & Compost Schedule

| Source | Annual volume | C : N role |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Cattle manure (60 hd) | 200 t fresh ≈ 85 t DM | N & microbes |
| Acacia leaf litter | 15 t | Carbon, slow N |
| Moringa press‑cake | 5 t | High N |
| Biochar fines | 3 t | Structure, adsorption |

**Compost plan.** Static piles, 30 m windrow, turn every 10 days.  
Apply **3 t feddan‑¹** to MLB beds **after every 3rd harvest** (~April & Oct). Spot‑dress MSB and SAB basins at 1 t feddan‑¹ each winter.

---

## Honey Calendar & Purity Protocol

| Season | Hive zone | Dominant nectar | Harvest window |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Mar‑Jun | Cactus core | Opuntia | mid‑June |
| Jul‑Sep | Leaf‑moringa belts | Moringa | late‑Sept |
| Oct‑Dec | Sidr belts | **Sidr** | mid‑Nov |

*Move hives 3 days after last extraction; pull capped supers **before** relocation; confirm monofloral status by annual pollen‑spectrum lab test.*

---

## Energy Module (Post‑2029)

> **Deferred until 2029** to avoid capital drag in the establishment phase.

| Stream | Feedstock | Equipment (installed 2029) | Output |
|--------|-----------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Ethanol** | 4 % of cactus pads (≈30 t month⁻¹) | 1 m³ stainless fermenter + small distillation column | 3 000 L yr‑¹ |
| **Biodiesel** | 8 000 L moringa oil | 2 × 1 000 L trans‑ester reactors, glycerol settler | 7 600 L biodiesel + 800 L glycerol |
| Integration | Ethanol used as 10 % volume reactant; surplus sold locally. |

Commissioning planned **Q1 2029** once cash‑flow turns positive and honey export line is stable.

---

## Orientation Justification

* Rows **E‑W** (wind‑break, SAB, MLB) present a solid face to prevailing NW winds, maximising sand interception and casting afternoon shade onto leaf beds.
* Cactus rows **N‑S** equalise solar exposure, reduce fruit sun‑burn and simplify east‑west harvest lanes.
* 45° diagonal layout rejected (longer pipes, poorer wind control, uneven light).

## Operational Systems

### Fertility Management
- **Compost Production**: 40–60 cattle produce ≥200 t finished compost annually
- **Additional Inputs**: Acacia leaf litter, moringa press-cake, biochar
- **Application Rate**: 3 t feddan⁻¹ to leaf beds every 2–3 harvests

### Harvesting Methods
1. **Initial Phase**:
   - Leaf crops: Mangal (hand sickle) & drag nets
   - Cactus: Long-handle knives and pad carts
   - Fruit: Glove pickers (spineless cultivar when introduced)

2. **Scaled Phase**:
   - Upgrade to dual-lane 1.5 m mini-harvesters with 1.2 m sickle bar catcher lanes once >15 feddan leaf beds are in production

### Bee Management
- **Rotation Cycle**: Hive pads move from cactus core → leaf-moringa belts → Sidr rings
- **Purpose**: Ensures monofloral purity and prevents bloom overlap

### Implementation Timeline (First 36 Months)
| Period | Key Activities |
|--------|---------------|
| Y0–0.5 | Establish perimeter moringa, first cactus block, and mainlines |
| Y0.5–1 | Plant NW Sidr-Acacia belt; start 30 cm leaf beds; introduce 20 hives |
| Y1–2   | Expand cactus to 100 feddan; finish both belts; cattle herd to 60 head |
| Y2–3   | Fill cactus core to 150 feddan; begin Sidr honey harvest; evaluate mechanical leaf cutter |

### Design Parameters
- Tree rows oriented E-W, cactus rows N-S for optimal wind protection and light exposure
- Maintain 1.5 m traffic lanes on each side of every 1.2 m moringa strip
- No chemical pesticides – rely on biodiversity and neem spray

### Success Metrics
1. ≥350 t DM feed/year
2. 100% in-house biodiesel production
3. Net cash ≥EGP 4M yr⁻¹ by Year 5
4. Soil organic-C increase of +1% in top 30 cm within 5 years
5. Premium-grade Sidr honey ≥400 kg/yr

- **Beekeeping:** Scale to 120 hives; implement refined rotation protocol; specialized harvest equipment; target 3+ t honey (including 600+ kg premium Sidr).
- **MSB:** Maintenance and continued seed production for MLB expansion.
- **MLB:** Expand intercrops to second SAB belt (additional 20 feddans); optimize leaf production for honey quality over quantity.
- **CFB:** Complete core planting (total 150 feddans); manage for optimal pollen/nectar production alongside fruit.
- **SAB:** Both belts established; complete leaf-moringa intercrops; significant Sidr bloom in both belts.
- **Cattle Herd:** Maintain at 80 heads (reduced from original 100), fed from on‑site leaf (MSB+MLB) + pad blend.
- **Composting:** All manure + pruned cactus + Acacia leaf litter + residues return to soil.
- **Energy:** Begin biodiesel processing from MSB seeds; ethanol production from cactus pad surplus.
- **Honey Processing:** Establish dedicated facility for extraction, filtration, packaging and specialized monofloral certification.

**Outcome Y4:** Honey production fully optimized with three distinct monofloral products; cattle operations scaled to complement rather than compete with beekeeping priorities.

## Seed‑to‑Field Pipeline (MLB in SAB Intercrop)

1. **MSB Pods** → shell, dry @<10 % moisture.
2. **Nursery:** 1 seed/plug; 6 weeks to transplant.
3. **Field:**
   - **Year 3+:** Four 30 cm MLB rows (forming 1.2 m strips) with 1.5 m harvest lanes between SAB tree rows
   - **Spacing:** MLB rows provide 1.8 m buffer from tree trunks for root zone separation
4. **Rotation:** Every 4–5 years MLB strips refurbished using fresh seedlings; old rows chipped for mulch.

---

## Water Infrastructure Plan

1. **Phase 0 (Q4 2025):** Complete hydrogeological assessment; secure water rights/permits
2. **Year 1 Q1 (Jan-Mar 2026):** 
   - Complete primary well drilling (target depth 150-200 m)
   - Install submersible pump system and power supply
   - Construct initial water storage facility (100 m³)
3. **Year 1 Q2 (Apr-Jun 2026):**
   - Complete pumping system and filtration
   - Install main distribution lines to priority planting areas
   - Begin monitoring of extraction rates and water quality

---

### Climate Alignment Notes

- **Planting** timed for mild El Tor winters (Jan–Feb) → lower evapotranspiration at establishment.
- **Pad & Leaf harvest** scheduled pre‑summer heat peaks (May) and post‑summer (Sep) to minimise wilt losses.
- **Hive moves** aligned with cactus bloom (Mar–Apr), moringa bloom (Aug–Oct) and Sidr bloom (Oct–Dec).
- **Sidr & Acacia** planted during Q4 to maximize establishment before summer heat.
- **MLB intercrops** introduced only after SAB provides sufficient microclimate benefits (Year 3+).

---

## Sidr & Acacia Management

- **Planting Grid:** 6 × 6 m spacing (2 Sidr : 1 Acacia ratio)
- **Intercropping Timeline:**
  - **Years 1-2:** Establishment without intercrops
  - **Year 3:** Begin four 30 cm moringa leaf beds with 1.5 m harvest lanes between tree rows
  - **Year 4:** Complete intercropping in both belts
- **Irrigation:** Basin irrigation during establishment only (≈250 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹)
- **Functions:**
  - **Sidr:** Premium honey production (autumn bloom), windbreak, microclimate for MLB
  - **Acacia:** Nitrogen fixation, leaf litter for compost, biodiversity support, wind protection
- **Pruning Schedule:** Minimal intervention after establishment, light shaping in Year 3
- **Integration:** Leaf-moringa intercrops introduced only when trees provide adequate microclimate (Year 3+)
