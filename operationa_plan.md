## Project Scope — "El Tor Integrated Desert Farm"

| Item | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Purpose** | Build a closed‑loop, 150‑feddan (≈ 0.63 km²) regenerative farm in El Tor, South Sinai that (1) feeds ≈ 30 beef cattle year‑round, (2) produces its own biodiesel & ethanol, and (3) generates three cash streams — cactus fruit, moringa oil + press‑cake, and monofloral honey (cactus, moringa, premium Sidr). |
| **Land‑use architecture** | A – Wind‑break ring: 4 × 4 m moringa seed trees, ≈ 25 feddans (continuous 30 m band).<br>B – Sidr + Acacia belts: two rings totalling 30 feddans; tree grid 6 × 6 m, pattern 1 Acacia : 2 Sidr.<br>  • Leaf‑moringa intercrops: 4 rows × 30 cm (1.2 m) + 1.5 m lanes between every tree row.<br>C – Cactus‑fig core: ≈ 85 feddans; rows N‑S, 2.5 m × 1.5 m.  <!-- ~57 % of 150 feddans --> <br>D – Service / residential hub: ≈ 10 feddans centre‑east (roads, compost yard, workshop, housing).<br>(Option) Expand MSB area by 5–8 feddans if extra feed security desired. |
| **Target outputs** (steady‑state, Year 5) | • Feed: ≈ 100 t DM yr‑¹ (cactus pads ½ + leaf‑moringa from MSB & SAB intercropping) → 28-32 cattle.<br>• Oil: ≈ 5 000 L moringa oil yr‑¹ + 3.2 t press‑cake.<br>• Honey: cactus (spring), moringa (summer) & 200–250 kg "3assal Sidr" (autumn).<br>• Fruit: 4–6 t feddan‑¹ × 85 f → 340–510 t fresh pads + 425-500 t fruit → farm‑gate revenue ≈ EGP 3–5 M yr‑¹.<br>• Note: Ethanol (1 000–2 000 L yr‑¹ from cactus pads) and biodiesel production planned for Phase II (Years 6+). |
| **Water plan** | Total initial demand ≈ 0.42 Mm³ yr‑¹ (aligned with the current 1 800 m³ d‑¹ extraction permit). Expansion above this threshold is contingent on drilling a second well or adding seasonal storage (STES reservoir).<br>– Cactus drip: 400–600 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹ (deep pulse, 12‑day).<br>– Leaf‑moringa porous pipe: 2 300 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹.<br>– Sidr basins & Acacia: ≈ 250 m³ feddan‑¹ yr‑¹ (establishment only). <br>– **System losses**: 5% allocation for leaks, filter backwash, and evaporation. |

> - **SAB Intercropping:** Each 6 m space between Sidr/Acacia rows accommodates four 30 cm MLB strips (1.2 m total) plus 1.5 m lanes on each side, maintaining 1.8 m buffer from tree trunks
> - **MSB Configuration:** Moringa seed trees in perimeter arranged in 4 × 4 m grid with E-W row orientation to maximize wind protection
> - **CFB Layout:** Cactus rows run N-S (perpendicular to prevailing winds) to equalize solar exposure and reduce fruit sunburn
> - **Infrastructure Integration:** All support facilities strategically positioned downwind (eastern portion) of production areas
> 
> *Note: MLB figures marked with asterisk represent intercropped area within SAB belts, not additional land area

## Tree Inventory & Planting Density Calculations

| Tree Type | Spacing | Trees per Feddan | Target Area (feddans) | Total Trees | Notes |
|-----------|---------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Moringa Seed Trees (MSB)** | 4 × 4 m | 250 | 25 | 6,250 | Perimeter windbreak and expanded production area |
| **Sidr (Ziziphus)** | 6 × 6 m | 111 | 20 | 2,220 | 2:1 ratio with Acacia in SAB |
| **Acacia** | 6 × 6 m | 111 | 10 | 1,110 | 1:2 ratio with Sidr in SAB |
| **Acacia (Integrated in CFB)** | **6 × 6 m** | **111** | **85** | **9,435** | Intercropped throughout entire CFB area at 6×6m spacing |
| **Cactus (Opuntia)** | 2.5 × 1.5 m | 1,111 | 85 | 94,435 | N-S row orientation |
| **Moringa Leaf (MLB)** | 30 cm rows | 13,333 plants/feddan | Intercropped in SAB | 66,665-99,998 | Intercropped between SAB tree rows (equivalent to 5-7.5 feddans) |

### Calculation Methodology
- **MSB**: 25 feddans × 250 trees/feddan = 6,250 trees
- **SAB Total**: 30 feddans with 111 trees/feddan = 3,330 total trees
  - **Sidr (67%)**: 2,220 trees
  - **Acacia (33%)**: 1,110 trees
- **CFB**: 85 feddans × 1,111 plants/feddan = 94,435 cactus plants
- **CFB-integrated Acacia**: 85 feddans × 111 trees/feddan = 9,435 trees (intercropped within entire CFB area)
- **MLB**: Intercropped in SAB (30 feddans) utilizing spaces between tree rows; equivalent production to 5-7.5 dedicated feddans

### Land Area Verification
- **Total Allocated Area**: 140-150 feddans (93-100% of 150 feddans) - MLB area not counted separately as it's intercropped
- **Infrastructure & Support**: 10 feddans (≈6% of total)
- **Buffer/Expansion Reserve**: 0-10 feddans
- **Note on Intercropping**: Both CFB-integrated Acacia and MLB utilize the same land area as their host systems (intercropped), not additional land area

### Establishment Timeline
- **Year 1**: 15 feddans MSB (3,750 trees) + 30 feddans CFB (33,330 plants) + 15 feddans SAB (1,665 trees) + CFB-integrated Acacia begun (3,330 trees)
- **Year 2**: Expand MSB to 20 feddans + expand CFB to 50 feddans + expand SAB to 25 feddans + CFB-integrated Acacia to 5,550 trees
- **Year 3**: Expand MSB to 22 feddans + introduce MLB intercrops within SAB (equivalent to 10 feddans) + expand CFB to 70 feddans + CFB-integrated Acacia to 7,770 trees
- **Year 4**: Expand MSB to 25 feddans + complete CFB to 85 feddans + finalize SAB to 30 feddans + complete CFB-integrated Acacia to 9,435 trees + expand MLB intercropping throughout entire SAB (equivalent to 25 feddans)

**Development sequence:**
> 1. **Year 1 (2026):** Establish core MSB, well infrastructure, first SAB belt (15 feddans), **accelerated CFB blocks (30 feddans)**, integrated infrastructure zone
> 2. **Year 2 (2027):** Complete second SAB belt, expand CFB to 50 feddans, develop honey processing within existing infrastructure footprint
> 3. **Year 3 (2028):** Introduce MLB as intercrops within mature SAB (first belt), expand CFB to 70 feddans, optimize infrastructure utilization
> 4. **Year 4 (2029):** Complete CFB core (85 feddans), expand MLB intercropping to second SAB belt, maintain infrastructure within 6% total land area

**Infrastructure Optimization:** All infrastructure components are strategically consolidated to maintain the 6% maximum land allocation, with internal rebalancing as priorities shift from water systems in early years to processing facilities in later years.

- **CFB:** Complete core planting (total 85 feddans); manage for optimal pollen/nectar production alongside fruit.
- **SAB:** Both belts established; complete leaf-moringa intercrops; significant Sidr bloom in both belts.
- **Cattle Herd:** Increase to 18-22 head based on demonstrated feed production; enhance feeding with dehydrated pads to improve DM content.
- **Composting:** All manure + pruned cactus + Acacia leaf litter + residues return to soil.
- **Energy:** Begin biodiesel processing from MSB seeds; delay full ethanol production to Year 6.
- **Honey Processing:** Establish dedicated facility for extraction, filtration, packaging and specialized monofloral certification.
- **Water Management:** Complete water use efficiency audit; maintain 150 m³ buffer capacity (5% of monthly extraction).

**Outcome Y4:** Honey production fully optimized with cactus and moringa monofloral products; Sidr honey trials expanded; cattle operations scaled to match feed production capacity (18-22 head).

| **Moringa Leaf (MLB)** | Fresh t | 0 | 0 | 18 | 60 | MLB intercrops established Y3-Q2 in mature SAB (first belt); expanded to entire SAB by Y4 |
| **Moringa Seeds** | kg | 0 | 620 | 1,980 | 3,750 | First pods Y2-Q1 (1,750 trees × 0.36 kg); Y3 (3,300 trees × 0.6 kg); Y4 (4,500 trees × 0.84 kg) |
| **Moringa Oil** | L | 0 | 185 | 590 | 1,125 | ~30% oil extraction rate from seeds; processing begins Y2-Q4 |
| **Cactus Pads (CFB)** | Fresh t | 0 | 70 | 100 | 150 | Year 1 establishment only; first significant harvest in Y2-Q3 from 30 feddans |
| **Cactus Fruit** | t | 0 | 16 | 55 | 105 | First fruit production Y2-Q3; full production from mature plants (70+ feddans) by Y4 |
| **Sidr Honey** | kg | 0 | 0 | 30 | 45 | First trial Sidr hives in Y3-Q4; limited production in Y4; premium production from Y6 |
| **Cactus Honey** | kg | 0 | 80 | 270 | 600 | First small harvest Y2-Q4; commercial production from Y3 |
| **Moringa Honey** | kg | 0 | 60 | 150 | 400 | Begins Y2-Q3; increases with MLB expansion and hive count |
| **Dehydrated Cactus Pads** | DM t | 0 | 0 | 10 | 18 | Begins Y3 after dehydrator installation; increases pad DM% from 10% to 20% |

> **Calculation Basis:**
> - **MSB Leaf:** 15 feddans × ~0.75 t/feddan in Y1 (establishment only); 20 feddans × ~1.6 t/feddan in Y2; 22 feddans × ~2 t/feddan in Y3; 25 feddans × ~2.6 t/feddan in Y4
> - **MLB Leaf:** Intercropped in SAB (first belt only) × ~1.6 t/feddan in Y3 (partial year); Intercropped throughout SAB × ~2.4 t/feddan in Y4
> - **MSB Seeds:** Per-tree yield increases with maturity and beekeeping integration: 0.36 kg/tree in Y2, 0.6 kg/tree in Y3, 0.84 kg/tree in Y4 (beekeeping provides ~20% yield boost through improved pollination)
> - **Moringa Oil:** 30% extraction rate from dried seeds after MLB planting allocation (80-160 kg/yr reserved for MLB intercropping)
> - **Allocation Strategy:** Total seed harvest → MLB propagation needs (with 60% buffer) → seed bank reserves → oil production
> - **Cactus Pads:** 30 feddans × ~2.3 t/feddan in Y2; 70 feddans × ~1.4 t/feddan in Y3; 85 feddans × ~1.8 t/feddan in Y4
> - **Cactus Fruit:** 30 feddans × ~0.53 t/feddan in Y2; 70 feddans × ~0.8 t/feddan in Y3; 85 feddans × ~1.24 t/feddan in Y4
> - **Honey:** Based on hive productivity of ~15-20 kg/hive/year across all floral sources; limited in early years during establishment
> - **Feed DM (Y4):** 150 t fresh pads (15 t DM @ 10%) + 18 t dehydrated pads (17 t DM @ ~95%) + 125 t fresh moringa leaf (25 t DM @ 20%) = 57 t DM total, sufficient for ~22 cattle at 7 kg DM/hd·d

## Key Plant Species & Their Roles

### Moringa (Moringa oleifera)
**System importance:** Primary multi-function species providing feed, oil, and nectar.
- **Revenue streams:** High-value oil (≈5,000 L/yr), protein-rich press-cake (3.2 t/yr), summer honey.
- **Feed value:** 25-30% protein DM, excellent amino acid profile, high vitamin content.
- **Risks:** Frost sensitive; requires irrigation management; susceptible to aphids during stress periods.
- **Management strategy:** Dual cultivation approach (MSB for seeds, MLB for leaf production) maximizes utility while providing system redundancy.

### Cactus Fig (Opuntia ficus-indica)
**System importance:** Core production species providing fruit, fodder, and water storage.
- **Revenue streams:** Primary cash crop (425-500 t fruit/yr), spring honey.
- **Feed value:** Low protein (4-6%) but high energy and water content; excellent drought buffer.
- **Risks:** Susceptible to cochineal insects; fruit quality affected by humidity at ripening.
- **Management strategy:** North-south row orientation maximizes light interception; scheduled pad harvesting maintains plant vigor and feed quality.
### Sidr (Ziziphus spina-christi)
**System importance:** Deep-rooted native tree providing premium honey, shade, and soil improvement.
- **Revenue streams:** Premium "3assal Sidr" honey (200-250 kg/yr), highest value product per unit.
- **Ecological value:** Drought-resistant native species; supports beneficial insects; deep root system accesses subsurface moisture.
- **Risks:** Slow establishment; requires protection during early growth.
- **Management strategy:** Strategic placement in belts; 2:1 ratio with Acacia for nitrogen balance; prunings provide valuable biochar feedstock.

### Acacia (Acacia nilotica/tortilis)
**System importance:** Nitrogen-fixing support species enhancing soil fertility.
- **Revenue streams:** Indirect through soil improvement and system resilience.
- **Ecological value:** Fixes 40-80 kg N/ha/yr; provides shade; contributes to windbreak function.
- **Risks:** Potential for excessive spread if not managed; thorns require careful handling.
- **Management strategy:** Intercropped with Sidr at 1:2 ratio; periodic pruning provides biochar feedstock; woody biomass excellent for biochar production.

### System Integration Benefits
The plant selection creates complementary seasonal production cycles, diversified revenue streams, and ecological resilience through functional diversity. The spatial arrangement optimizes water use efficiency while the multi-story design maximizes photosynthetic capture per unit area.

### Biological Production Timelines

| Species | First Seed/Propagation Material | Peak Production | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Moringa** | 10-12 months after planting | 24+ months | First year focuses on establishment; limited seed production in Year 2; full production Year 3+ |
| **Cactus Fig** | No harvest Year 1 | 24+ months | Year 1: establishment only; Year 2: first harvestable pads; Year 3+: optimal propagation material |
| **Sidr** | 30-36 months for viable cuttings | 48+ months | Very slow initial growth; no viable propagation material until Year 3 |
| **Acacia** | 24-30 months for first seed pods | 36+ months | No seed production Year 1; minimal Year 2; viable quantities Year 3+ |

### Expansion Capacity (Annual New Planting Potential)

| Year | MSB Potential | MLB Potential | CFB Potential | SAB Potential | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 2026 | Initial only | None | Initial only | Initial only | Establishment year; no propagation material produced |
| 2027 | None | None | 2-3 feddans | None | Limited pad availability; all trees still immature |
| 2028 | 2-3 feddans | 3-5 feddans | 8-10 feddans | 1-2 feddans | First significant moringa seed availability; limited Sidr material |
| 2029+ | 5-8 feddans | 10-15 feddans | 20-25 feddans | 5-8 feddans | Full propagation capacity as trees reach maturity |

### Propagation Protocols

**Moringa Seed Production:**
- Year 1: Focus exclusively on establishment and root development
- Year 2: First limited seed harvest (10-12 months after planting)
- Year 3+: Dedicate 20% of MSB for seed-only harvest
- Hand-collect mature pods before splitting; dry on mesh racks (optimal harvest: Mar-May, Sep-Nov)
- Shell, clean, and store in sealed containers with silica packets
- **Optimal planting months:** Feb-Mar, Sep-Oct (avoid extreme summer heat)

**Cactus Pad Propagation:**
- Year 1: No harvest; focus on establishment and root development
- Year 2: First limited pad harvest (12-14 months after planting)
- Year 3+: Implement systematic pad harvesting rotation
- Cure 14-21 days in shade to develop callus before planting
- Maintain mother-plant blocks with optimal spacing for pad production
- **Optimal propagation months:** Oct-Nov, Feb-Mar (avoid summer heat and winter cold)

**Sidr & Acacia Propagation:**
- Year 1-2: No propagation material; focus on establishment
- **Sidr:** First viable cuttings available only in Year 3 (30-36 months after planting)
  - **Optimal cutting collection:** Nov-Dec (after fruit harvest)
  - **Optimal planting:** Feb-Mar (before spring growth flush)
- **Acacia:** First seed pods in late Year 2/early Year 3; scarify seeds before planting
  - **Optimal seed collection:** Dec-Jan
  - **Optimal planting:** Feb-Mar, Oct-Nov
- Maintain dedicated nursery area (0.5 feddan) with specialized irrigation

### Expansion Strategy

1. **Year 1 (2026):** Initial establishment only; no expansion capacity
   - **Primary planting window:** Feb-Mar (all species)
   - **Secondary window:** Oct-Nov (cactus only)
2. **Year 2 (2027):** Very limited expansion using purchased/imported material if needed
   - **Expansion planting:** Feb-Mar, Oct-Nov (weather dependent)
3. **Year 3 (2028):** Begin modest expansion using first on-site propagation materials
   - **Moringa & cactus expansion:** Feb-Mar, Sep-Oct
   - **Tree expansion:** Feb-Mar only
4. **Year 4+ (2029+):** Implement full expansion cycle as trees reach maturity
   - **Coordinated planting calendar:** Primary (Feb-Mar), Secondary (Sep-Nov)

**External Material Requirements:**
- **Year 1:** All initial planting material purchased/imported
- **Year 2:** Supplemental material needed for any expansion
- **Year 3:** Partial self-sufficiency for moringa and cactus; still require external Sidr/Acacia
- **Year 4+:** Complete self-sufficiency for all propagation needs

> **Note:** First-year focus is exclusively on establishment and plant health. Premature harvesting of propagation material would compromise system development. Expansion timeline adjusted to biological realities of tree maturation cycles.

## MSB Seed Allocation Strategy

### Seed Production & Allocation by Year

| Year | Total MSB Seeds | MLB Planting Needs* | Available for Oil | Oil Production (30%) |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 2026 | 0 kg            | 0 kg                | 0 kg              | 0 L                  |
| 2027 | 880 kg          | 120 kg              | 760 kg            | 228 L → 240-265 L    |
| 2028 | 2,970 kg        | 180 kg              | 2,790 kg          | 837 L → 850-890 L    |
| 2029 | 6,250 kg        | 240 kg              | 6,010 kg          | 1,803 L → 1,800-1,875 L |

*MLB planting needs calculation based on SAB intercropping requirements:*
- **Year 2 (2027):** Planning for 15 feddan-equivalent MLB intercropping in Year 3
  - 15 feddans × 13,333 plants/feddan = 200,000 plants needed
  - At 80% germination rate: 200,000 ÷ 0.8 = 250,000 seeds required
  - Average moringa seed weight: 0.3 g/seed → 250,000 × 0.3g = 75 kg
  - +60% buffer for replacements and failures: 75 kg × 1.6 = 120 kg
- **Year 3 (2028):** Additional 20 feddan-equivalent MLB intercropping expansion
  - Similar calculations yield 180 kg seed requirement
- **Year 4 (2029):** Final 15 feddan-equivalent MLB intercropping to complete system
  - Similar calculations yield 240 kg seed requirement

### Key Management Protocols

**Propagation Buffer Management:**
- 60% seed buffer maintained to account for:
  - Germination rate variations (80-95% depending on seed quality)
  - Seedling mortality in harsh intercrop conditions
  - Replacement needs for MLB plant turnover
  - Emergency replanting requirements

**Oil Production Optimization:**
- Extraction efficiency increases progressively:
  - Year 2: 30% extraction (baseline)
  - Year 3: 30-32% extraction (improved techniques)
  - Year 4: 32-35% extraction (optimized processing)
- Beekeeping integration provides 20-25% yield boost through improved pollination

**Seed Banking Strategy:**
- Maintain 2-year seed stock for emergency replanting
- Excess buffer seeds from previous years cycled into oil production after 24 months
- Seed quality monitored quarterly with germination tests
- Climate-controlled storage maintains viability (seed moisture <10%, temperature <20°C)

This integrated approach ensures system resilience while maximizing biodiesel feedstock availability, with buffer seed allocation providing both operational security and flexibility in production targets.


## Biochar Production & Land‑Expansion Loop

**Purpose.** Gradually develop biochar production capacity from on‑site residues to rehabilitate new beds or tree lines as the system matures.

| Feedstock (dry) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3+ | Pyrolysis note | Biochar yield (Y3+) |
|-----------------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Cactus pad trimmings | 0 t | 2 t | 5 t | Rotary drum, 400 °C | ~1.3 t |
| Acacia & Sidr prunings (SAB) | 0 t | 1 t | 4 t | Batch retort, 450 °C | ~1 t |
| Acacia prunings (CFB-integrated) | 0 t | 3 t | 28 t | Batch retort, 450 °C | ~7 t |
| Spoiled moringa press‑cake + leaf litter | 0 t | 0.7 t | 3 t | Mixed with woody feedstock | ~0.7 t |
| **Total** | **0 t** | **6.7 t** | **40 t** |  | **≈ 10 t biochar yr⁻¹** |

> Note: Reduced cactus pad usage allows prioritization for propagation. The much higher volume of woody biomass from the extensive CFB-integrated Acacia system (9,435 trees by Year 4) provides significant feedstock for biochar production.

**Application.** Incorporate 3 t feddan⁻¹ with compost into new cactus or tree expansion plots; priority = marginal corners and newly ripped beds.

**Reactor set‑up (2026 Q4).** One 2 m³ top‑lift retort (charcoal style) + small 500 kg h⁻¹ rotary kiln for continuous pad flow. Syngas routed to water pre‑heater.

## Biochar Production & Carbon Sequestration Module

**Processing Unit Specifications**
- 2 × 3 m³ retort kilns (batch mode)
- 1 × continuous feed rotary kiln (200 kg/h capacity)
- Syngas recovery for thermal integration
- Annual capacity: 100 t feedstock → 25 t biochar

- **Conversion Efficiency:** 85-90% of oil to biodiesel
- **Quality Control:** Regular testing for cetane number, viscosity, and cloud point
- **Storage Protocol:** Climate-controlled tanks with 3-month capacity
- **Carbon Methodology:** Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology VM0025

### Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Seed yield variability | Maintain 25% buffer stock |
| Processing equipment failure | Redundant critical components |
| Quality inconsistency | Batch testing and blending protocols |
| Carbon market volatility | Diversify credit buyers, 30% forward contracts |

This biodiesel production plan integrates with the expanded moringa cultivation schedule and provides both operational self-sufficiency and additional carbon credit revenue streams by Year 4.

| Mar‑Jun | Cactus core | Opuntia | mid‑June |
| Jul‑Sep | Leaf‑moringa belts | Moringa | late‑Sept |
| Oct‑Dec | Sidr belts | **Sidr** | mid‑Nov |

### Beehive Management Key Points

* **Year 1 (2026):** Focus on infrastructure, training and equipment acquisition
* **Hive Placement:** Position hives on elevated stands facing SE, 10-15 per feddan
* **Introduction Protocol:** Introduce hives only when adequate nectar sources are established
* **Rotation Protocol:** Move hives 3 days after last extraction; pull capped supers **before** relocation
* **Quality Control:** Confirm monofloral status by annual pollen‑spectrum lab test
* **Water Supply:** Maintain clean water sources within 200m of all hive locations
* **Pest Management:** Monthly varroa mite monitoring; organic treatments only
* **Winter Care:** Reduce hive entrances during non-flowering periods; supplement feed if necessary

*Note: Begin with 10-15 hives in Year 2 when first flowers appear, expanding to 70-80 by Year 4 as flowering areas mature.*

## Orientation Justification

* Rows **E‑W** (wind‑break, SAB, MLB) present a solid face to prevailing NW winds, maximising sand interception and casting afternoon shade onto leaf beds.
* Cactus rows **N‑S** equalise solar exposure, reduce fruit sun‑burn and simplify east‑west harvest lanes.
* 45° diagonal layout rejected (longer pipes, poorer wind control, uneven light).

## Operational Systems

### Fertility Management
- **Compost Production**: 40–60 cattle produce ≥200 t finished compost annually
- **Additional Inputs**: Acacia leaf litter, moringa press-cake, biochar
- **Application Rate**: 3 t feddan⁻¹ to leaf beds every 2–3 harvests

### Harvesting Methods
1. **Initial Phase**:
   - Leaf crops: Mangal (hand sickle) & drag nets
   - Cactus: Long-handle knives and pad carts
   - Fruit: Glove pickers (spineless cultivar when introduced)

2. **Scaled Phase**:
   - Upgrade to dual-lane 1.5 m mini-harvesters with 1.2 m sickle bar catcher lanes once >15 feddan leaf beds are in production

### Bee Management
- **Rotation Cycle**: Hive pads move from cactus core → leaf-moringa belts → Sidr rings
- **Purpose**: Ensures monofloral purity and prevents bloom overlap

### Implementation Timeline (First 36 Months)
| Period | Key Activities |
|--------|---------------|
| Y0–0.5 | Establish perimeter moringa, first cactus block, and mainlines |
| Y0.5–1 | Plant NW Sidr-Acacia belt; start 30 cm leaf beds; introduce 20 hives |
| Y1–2   | Expand cactus to 100 feddan; finish both belts; cattle herd to 60 head |
| Y2–3   | Fill cactus core to 150 feddan; begin Sidr honey harvest; evaluate mechanical leaf cutter |

### Design Parameters
- Tree rows oriented E-W, cactus rows N-S for optimal wind protection and light exposure
- Maintain 1.5 m traffic lanes on each side of every 1.2 m moringa strip
- No chemical pesticides – rely on biodiversity and neem spray

### Success Metrics
1. ≥350 t DM feed/year
2. 100% in-house biodiesel production
3. Net cash ≥EGP 4M yr⁻¹ by Year 5
4. Soil organic-C increase of +1% in top 30 cm within 5 years
5. Premium-grade Sidr honey ≥400 kg/yr

## Seed‑to‑Field Pipeline (MLB in SAB Intercrop)

1. **MSB Production & Seed Collection:**
   - Mature pods hand-collected before natural splitting
   - Dried on mesh racks in dedicated drying facility
   - Seeds manually extracted, cleaned, and graded

2. **Seed Allocation Priority:**
   - First tier: MLB intercropping needs (120-240 kg/yr)
   - Second tier: Seed banking for system resilience (2-year reserve)
   - Third tier: Oil production for biodiesel

3. **MLB Nursery Process:**
   - 1 seed/plug in specialized trays; 80-95% germination rate
   - 6-week growing period before field-ready
   - Hardening period of 7-10 days before transplanting

4. **Field Layout:**
   - **SAB Intercropping Only:** Four 30 cm MLB rows (forming 1.2 m strips) with 1.5 m harvest lanes between SAB tree rows
   - **Spacing:** MLB rows provide 1.8 m buffer from tree trunks for root zone separation
   - **No separate MLB blocks:** All MLB is intercropped within the SAB belts

5. **System Renewal:**
   - Every 4–5 years MLB strips refurbished using fresh seedlings
   - Old rows chipped for mulch or biochar feedstock
   - Staggered renewal ensures continuous production

6. **Seed Quality Management:**
   - Quarterly germination testing of stored seed
   - Climate-controlled storage (humidity <40%, temperature <20°C)
   - Oldest viable seed redirected to oil production after 24 months

> Note: Nursery numbers indicate propagation activities before field transplanting. Cactus pad callusing occurs in dedicated nursery areas before field planting. The establishment schedule aligns with optimal seasonal planting windows (Feb-Mar, Oct-Nov) and ensures adequate infrastructure development precedes major planting operations. CFB-integrated Acacia trees (13,320 total) are planted as intercropped support trees within the entire cactus production system at 6×6m spacing. MLB plants are only intercropped within SAB belts, not as separate blocks.
